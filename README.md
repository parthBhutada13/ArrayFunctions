# **Java Array Operations**  

This Java project takes user input, processes arrays, and performs operations like finding odd/even numbers and calculating differences between elements.  

## **Files and Functions**  
- **`Main.java`** – Runs the program, calls `UserInput` and `ArrayFunctions`.  
- **`UserInput.java`** – Reads 5 numbers from the user into an array.  
- **`ArrayFunctions.java`** – Performs:  
  - **`oddEven(int[] array)`** – Splits numbers into odd and even lists.  
  - **`difference(int[] array)`** – Computes differences between adjacent elements and finds the smallest difference index.  

## **Usage**  
1. Compile and run `Main.java`.  
2. Enter 5 numbers when prompted.  
3. The program displays computed results.
